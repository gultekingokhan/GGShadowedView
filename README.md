![Example](/Example/GGShadowedView/xcode-screenshot.png "Example")

## Usage
Just set your UIView's class to `GGShadowedView` on an interface builder file. 

You can update these properties from interface builder as designables:
- [x] Corner radius 
- [x] Background color
- [x] Is tappable
- [x] Shadow color

ðŸ¤™ Don't forget to try "tappable" option. It has a nice depth effect while tapping the view like a button.

## Installation

GGShadowedView is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'GGShadowedView'
```

## One last note
ðŸ‘‹ Please, don't hesitate for reaching me out. I wrote this library for my own needs in a very short time. So, it would be great to get feedback from you!
